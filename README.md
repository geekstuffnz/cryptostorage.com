# Introduction
CryptoStorage is an open source tool to generate offline storage for multiple cryptocurrencies.  This tool generates [key pairs](https://cryptostorage.com/#faq_key_pair) in your device's browser which can store cryptocurrency without exposing private keys to an internet-connected device.  Generated key pairs can be easily printed and saved to digital files for long-term storage.

This tool is security-focused.  Funds are never entrusted to a third party.  Private keys can be passphrase-protected and [split into pieces](https://cryptostorage.com/#faq_split_keys) which can be geographically separated so funds are not accessible at any one location.  Recommendations are automatically provided to improve the security of the tool's environment.

# Main Features
- Generate offline storage for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Keys are generated only in your device's browser so funds are never entrusted to a third party.
- 100% open source, client-side, and free to use.  No account necessary.
- Private keys can be passphrase-protected using [CryptoJS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js).  Also supports [BIP38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
- Storage can be split into pieces which can be geographically separated so funds are not accessible at any one location.
- Print or save to digital files (json, csv, and txt) for long-term storage.
- Print and cut out "crypto-cash" to easily tip people in real life.
- Recommendations are automatically provided to improve the security of the tool's environment:
	- Checks if the internet connection is active
	- Checks if the tool is downloaded and running locally
	- Checks if the browser is open source
	- Checks if the operating system is open source

# Using this Tool as Securely as Possible

Security is a spectrum.  The following procedure is recommended to use this tool as securely as possible:

1. [Download and verify the source code.](#download-and-verify-the-source-code)
2. Transfer cryptostorage.com-*[version]*.zip to a secure computer using a flash drive.
    - The computer should be disconnected from the internet and ideally will never connect to the internet again.
    - An open source operating system is recommended like [Tails](https://tails.boum.org), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), or [Raspbian for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).
3. Unzip cryptostorage.com-*[version]*.zip.
4. Open index.html in the unzipped folder in a browser.
    - An open source browser is recommended like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium).
5. Confirm that all environment checks pass.
    1. Go to Generate New Keys from the homepage.
    2. The notice bar at the top should indicate that all security checks pass.
6. Fill out the form and click Generate Keys.
    - Protecting your keys with a passphrase is *highly recommended*.  Otherwise anyone in possession of the unencrypted keys can access the funds.
    - Optionally split your keys for maximum security.
7. Save the generated keys to a flash drive or printed paper for safe keeping.  Geographic redundancy is highly recommended so if one location is lost due to fire, flood, theft, etc, there are backup copies at other locations.

The keys can be imported at any time by relaunching this tool in a secure environment.
 
⚠ **Do not lose the generated keys or the password or the funds will be lost.**

# Download and Verify the Source Code
Verifying the source code ensures you have a copy of this tool that has been publicly reviewed and has not been modified by an attacker.

Downloading and verifying the source code is *highly recommended* but not required to use this tool.

The source code can be verified in two ways. Either method is sufficient.

## Method #1: Verify the source code has the correct checksum.

1. Download cryptostorage-*[version]*.zip and cryptostorage-*[version]*-checksum.txt from the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptostorage/cryptostorage.com/releases).
2. Determine the SHA256 hash of the zip file.  Instructions depend on your operating system.<br>
 Linux: `sha256sum cryptostorage-[version].zip`<br>
 Mac: `openssl sha -sha256 cryptostorage-[version].zip`<br>
 Windows: `certUtil -hashfile cryptostorage-[version].zip SHA256`
3. Verify that the checksum matches the contents of the previously downloaded cryptostorage-*[version]*-checksum.txt.

## Method #2: Verify the source code has been signed by the developer's PGP key.

1. Install [PGP software](https://www.openpgp.org/) on your device.
2. Download the developer's public PGP key, "woodser.asc", from the [root of the GitHub source repository](https://github.com/cryptostorage/cryptostorage.com).
3. Import the PGP key: `gpg --import woodser.asc`
4. Download cryptostorage-*[version]*.zip, cryptostorage-*[version]*.sig, and woodser-pgp-fingerprint.txt from the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptostorage/cryptostorage.com/releases).
5. Verify the signature of cryptostorage-*[version]*.zip:
    ```
    gpg --verify cryptostorage-[version].sig cryptostorage-[version].zip
    ```
    You should see output with this RSA key:<br>
    ```
    gpg: Signature made Fri Jan 12 09:22:37 2018 EST
    gpg: using RSA key 52FD7C01877CA968C97118D055A10DD48ADEE5EF
    gpg: Good signature ...
    ```
    The RSA key will also match the contents of the previously downloaded woodser-pgp-fingerprint.txt.<br><br>
    Note: You will probably also see a warning that the key is not certified with a trusted signature. This is expected unless you told PGP to trust woodser’s PGP key, which is not necessary.
